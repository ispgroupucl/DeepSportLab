    "OpenPifPaf uses the standard convention of PyTorch models to pad convolutions. \n",
    "Let's start with an example: a single layer of a 3x3 conv with stride 2 that is padded with 1. For an output feature map of size 2x2, the input must be of size 3x3. This generalization holds: the input must be of size `(nx * stride + 1, ny * stride + 1)`.\n",
    "The models that OpenPifPaf uses have an intermediate layer with stride 16. Therefore, good input image sizes are multiples of 16 plus 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is usually not a problem if the input size is not perfect. There will just be a small margin on the right side and bottom of the image that is not \"covered\" by a feature map cell."
